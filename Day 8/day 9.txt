ADO.net is greate for databases

	but how to work with other data sources ?
	Database - (ADO.net) - learn this
	Collections (List) (Data Structure) - learn it
	FileSystem - filesystem (Learn it)
	AD - OLEDB (learn it)
	Mail box (OLEDB) (learn)
	XML Files (XPath and XQuery) - bit difficult then programming, learn it


		Instead - use LINQ


	how to wrk in same way with any kind f data, 
		LINQ (Language Integrated Query) - connect to any data source and use the same language to work with data
